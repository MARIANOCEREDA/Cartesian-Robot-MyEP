# Cartesian-Robot-MyEP

Project carried out for microcontrollers management.

An STM32 microcontroller was used, with ARM CORTEX M8 processor. 

The project consists of a Cartesian robot in charge of classifying objects according to their color.

Materials used:
- STM32 (Blue pill) with ARM CORTEX M8.
- Arduino for color processing
- Stepper motors for axis control
- Servomotor for gripper control
- Limit switches
- Push buttons
